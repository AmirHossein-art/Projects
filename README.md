3. Quantity takeoff and cost estimation of construction projects using Building Information Modeling (BIM). |

   Course: Construction Project Management Systems of Iran
   
   Instructor: Dr. Amin Alvanchi
   
   Description: In this project, a residential building was modeled using Building Information Modeling (BIM). The quantity takeoff and cost estimation were conducted using the **Tadkar** platform based on the generated model.  
The project focused solely on architectural modeling, covering elements such as walls, ceilings, floors, and perimeter yard walls. Each element's type and material properties, including finishes, were also defined. The modeled building is a **single-story structure with a total area of 113 square meters**, occupying **50% of the project site**.
